# Note on updating systemd user instance and dbus environment variables
# * SDDM will source user default shell rc files in /usr/share/sddm/scripts/{Xsession,wayland-session}
# * SDDM then runs startplasma_{x11,wayland}
# * startplasma_{x11,wayland} will sync all current environment variables to dbus, systemd and klauncher
# This has the problem that in a non-graphical environment, systemd and dbus environemnts are not
# updated.
# Maybe we should sync variable at the end of zshenv. There are performance considerations, though,
# as the zshenv is sourced everytime for any instance of zsh
# probably should do it as part of .zlogin, which is only sourced once for login shell (after .zshrc).
